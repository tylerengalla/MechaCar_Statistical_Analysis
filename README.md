## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

According to our results, vehicle length and ground clearance (as well as intercept) are statistically unlikely to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model. In other words, they have a significant impact on MPG. 

When an intercept is statistically significant, it means there are other variables that we have not accounted for that contribute to variance of MPG. 

Our P-Value is 5.35e-11, which is much smaller than our assumed significant level of .05%. Therefore, we can stat there is sufficient evidence to reject our null hypothesis ,which means our slope of our linear model is not zero. 

R-sqaared is .7149, which means that roughly 72% of MPG predicition will be correct using this linear model.
